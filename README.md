# NBA Stats
Continuation of the i4software project. I plan to use this repo to update and house the code.

# Descripton
The website utilizes the open-source NBA Stats API to grab information about an NBA player and output it in an easy-to-read format. The CSS style file was taken and modified from a previously completed LinkedIn Learning course. The code to parse and format the data is written in JavaScript.
